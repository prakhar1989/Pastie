Pastie was born in the wee hours of the night when I was trying to learn how 
to use Sinatra and DataMapper to make simple apps. You can use it to save snippets of 
code to share it with others. As an added bonus: it adds beautiful syntax
coloring to it as well. Just paste your fugly code and press Ctrl-s to save.


Uses:
- Sinatra
- DataMapper (with MySQL)
- Syntaxi Gem
